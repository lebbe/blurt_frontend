# Welcome to My Blog

This is my first blog post written in MDX. MDX allows you to write JSX in Markdown documents.

Here is an example of a React component:

```jsx
import React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <h2>Hello, MDX!</h2>
    <p>This is a React component embedded in Markdown.</p>
  </div>
)

export default MyComponent
```
